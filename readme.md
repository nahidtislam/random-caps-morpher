#  random caps morpher

## randomly captilise your words

`with this you'll no longer need to think which letter letter to randomly capitilse!`

## instructions

1. type somthing in the textbox
2. see how cool the `output` is
3. press <kbd>⌘c</kbd> to copy `output`

### definitions
* real text: _output having no whitespaces_

## known issues
* the padding around the clear button is a little janky when there's no real texts
    * especially when running in macOS
* [solved] the counter doesn't animate the numbers properly _(feature only available on iOS 17)_
    
## feature; not a bug
* the `x` in the clear button remains unfilled __but tappable__ if the there're only whitespaces on the textbox
* landscape layout is only on the iPhone

## coming soon
* [] tests
    * [] test if the real text is random
    * [] test if increasing the capitalisation slider makes more of the output more capitalise
